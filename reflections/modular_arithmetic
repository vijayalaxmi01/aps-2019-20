Applying modulus operation on intermediate results instead of applying it on final results.

Helps for faster computation.

Based on distributive property, Modular arithmetic can be applied on addition, subtraction, multiplication.
example : (a+b)%c = ((a%c) + (b%c))%c

For division,multiplicative inverse is used.
example : a/b = a * (multpicative inverse of (1/b))
To find multiplicative inverse of x, we use formula: (x * MMI) % M = 1 
where M = 10^9 + 7
