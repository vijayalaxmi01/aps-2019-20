lookup table technique for array query problem : 
Index with minimum value is stored in lookup table.
lookup table is a 2D array.
Space complexity : O(n2)
Time complexity to populate the lookup table : O(n2)
Accessing time : O(1)

Square root decomposition for array query problem :
lookup table is a 1D array where each index stores a index with minimum value in a particular range.
Space complexity : O(sqrt(n))
Time complexity to populate the lookup table : O(n2)
Accessing time : O(sqrt(n))
Disadvantage : The lookup table stores minimum value of particular range for example minimum value between range 0 to 2, 3 to 5 and 6 to 8.
Suppose the minimum value between the range 1 to 4 is required then comparision should begin from index 1 to index 4.
